# Features

- **Multi-agent packaging** - one shared `spectra/` source installs natively into Claude Code
  (`.claude-plugin/`), OpenAI Codex (`.codex-plugin/` + `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`),
  Cursor (`.cursor-plugin/` + `.cursor-plugin/marketplace.json`), and Gemini CLI
  (`gemini-extension.json` + `commands/*.toml`). Every agent's manifest points at the same
  `skills/`, `protocol.md`, and `personas/` - no duplicated content; the `SKILL.md` bodies are
  tool-neutral (resolve `$SRC` to the plugin root, not a Claude env var), and Gemini's TOML
  commands inject the very same bodies via `@{skills/<name>/SKILL.md}`.
- **`spectra-install` skill** - scaffolds `docs/`, copies protocol + personas, installs the
  reflection hook, wires up AGENTS.md.
- **`spectra-update` skill** - re-syncs Spectra-owned files; copies **all** shipped persona
  files (additive - new/updated personas always arrive) but never touches the developer-owned
  `docs/spectra/personas.config` or a `user.md`, so the enabled set is preserved.
- **User (ICP) persona commands** - full CRUD over the repo's 👤 *User (ICP)* personas, one file
  per customer profile (`docs/spectra/personas/user-<slug>.md`; a legacy single `user.md` still
  works): **`spectra-add-user`** (guided dialog → new profile), **`spectra-update-user`** (read a
  profile back and refine it), **`spectra-remove-user`** (delete one), **`spectra-list-users`**
  (show them). Each profile carries an **Applies when / Skip when** block so reviews scope it in
  only for the changes that profile cares about - multiple distinct customers, each judged on its
  own slice. (Replaces the former single `spectra-setup`.)
- **`spectra-persona-enable` / `spectra-persona-disable` skills** - toggle any review persona on or off by
  adding/removing its slug in `docs/spectra/personas.config`. Run with no argument to pick from a
  numbered list. Any persona is toggleable, including the core four.
- **Protocol** (`spectra/protocol.md`) - route → spec → plan → build → test → review → merge → reflect.
  Specs are **living sources of truth**: routing a feature first decides net-new vs. modifying an
  existing spec, and any behavior change updates the owning spec in place so the spec never drifts
  from the shipped software.
- **Review personas** - engineer 🔧, tester 🧪, architect 📐, security 🔒 enabled by default, plus
  **optional** designer 🎨, compliance ⚖️, and analytics 📊 (shipped but off until enabled) and
  consumer-defined user 👤 (ICP) personas - one per customer profile, each present once
  `spectra-add-user` writes its `user-<slug>.md` and scoped per its Applies-when block. The active set
  is the slugs in **`docs/spectra/personas.config`** (developer-owned, seeded with the four core,
  preserved across updates); reviews are still **scoped per change** (triage which enabled
  personas apply). A shared `personas/persona.md` holds the review contract (inline-only comments,
  one issue each, concrete fixes, and the canonical emoji-tagged, severity-graded comment format);
  each persona file holds only its specific, opinionated checklist. Major/blocker feed `learnings.md`.
- **Reflection hook** - non-blocking `pre-commit` reminder to update the living docs.
- **Test suite** (`test.sh`) - validates manifests, hook behavior, install mechanics, and
  that the README's token figures match `spectra/`.
- **Token-count guard** (repo-local, not shipped) - `scripts/token-report.sh` measures
  `spectra/` (dependency-free `~4 chars/token`) and renders the README's token table behind
  `<!-- spectra:tokens -->` markers; `--write` updates it, `--check` verifies it. A
  repo-local `pre-commit` guard blocks any commit that edits `spectra/` without refreshing
  the figures, so the README's efficiency claim can't drift.
- **Branding assets** - `assets/logo.svg` (spectrum-loop wordmark) and
  `assets/protocol-flow.svg` (the route→…→reflect loop diagram), embedded in the README.
- **CI** (repo-local, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) - on push and PR: runs `test.sh`, re-runs
  the README token-drift guard (`token-report.sh --check`) so fork PRs and fresh clones are
  covered even though the local hook is untracked, and validates the PR title against
  Conventional Commits.
- **Conventional Commits** - commit messages and PR titles follow
  `<type>[scope][!]: <subject>`, checked by the dependency-free `scripts/check-commit-msg.sh`
  (repo-local; documented in `AGENTS.md`, enforced by CI on PR titles).
- **Plugin versioning & releases** (from the Trellis **plugin-release** template; owned, refreshed
  by `/trellis-update`) - the root `VERSION` is the single source of truth, mirrored into all seven
  manifests by `scripts/bump-version.sh` (`--check` fails CI on drift; `test.sh` section 11 wires
  it in). Merging a `VERSION` bump triggers `.github/workflows/release.yml` (on `workflow_run` of
  `CI` succeeding on `main`), which tags the bare-semver version and publishes a GitHub Release from
  `docs/releases/<x.y.z>.md`.
- **README "What's new"** (from the same template; owned) - a `## What's new` section carries a
  one-line headline for the latest release behind `<!-- whats-new:start/end -->` markers.
  `scripts/whats-new.sh` extracts the headline and rewrites the block; `.github/workflows/whats-new.yml`
  runs it on `workflow_run` of `Release` (so it survives the `GITHUB_TOKEN`-recursion rule that
  silences `release: [published]` for automated releases) and lands the change through a
  self-squash-merged PR (since `main` forbids direct pushes), so the front page stays current
  without manual edits.
